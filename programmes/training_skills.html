      <h2 class=large_margin>Training and Skills Development</h2>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      EA’s vision of changing the narrative of North East Story through entrepreneurship has gained
      momentum beyond boundaries of the state and country. Today, Entrepreneurship is being recognised
      as a tool which can be successfully used to counter unemployment, boost economy, promote the
      private sector, and encourage innovative thinking, which can be used in many other regions with
      similar contexts and challenges.
      </p>
      <h3 class='large_margin left_text'>BEST (Basic Entrepreneurial Skills Training)</h3>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      Entrepreneurs Associates proactively engages with the first generation entrepreneurs of Nagaland
      to promote and encourage entrepreneurship among the youths. Recognizing the efforts of EA, a
      partnership with the TATA Trusts, Sir Ratan Tata Trust/Navajbhai Ratan Tata Trust was formed in
      2014. This partnership launched a program to train young people in entrepreneurship. The
      objective of the program is to impart business skills to the unemployed and those with limited
      educational qualifications, particularly for the youths for whom career opportunities are limited.
      <br /><br />

      <img class='no_margin no_padding article_img halfimagery' src='../images/best2.png' alt='BEST Training' />
      <br /><br />
      The BEST program is proposed for a period of 30 months with a target to train 300 youths. The
      training module is designed for 90 hours, and completed within 45 days. Each training batch is
      called ‘Wave’. The training program includes lectures, discussions, and peer-to-peer learning.
      In addition, practical skills through participation in market surveys, and field visits to
      different establishments and businesses interviewing the entrepreneurs allow the trainees to
      get a feel of the existing market. The training is facilitated by various experts in the field
      of finances; project proposals; banking; soft skills and hard skills, from EA, external resource
      persons and successful entrepreneurs.

      <h3 class='large_margin left_text'>BBST (Basic Business Skills Training)</h3>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      Basic Business Skills Training (BBST) is a training program designed for entrepreneurs who have
      little, or no education.  EA conducted the BBST training for weavers and artisans with the primary
      focus to instill basic foundation of business and entrepreneurial ventures. The training strives
      to integrate sustainability and survivability through concept, creativity, and innovation in an
      increasingly competitive market. Rigorous sessions on business, entrepreneurship, financial
      management, market networking, customer services, credits and savings are discussed during the
      training.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3 class='large_margin left_text'>Affirmative Customer Experience (ACE)</h3>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      This program aims to provide skills to build confidence, become self- reliant, and grow, personally
      and professionally. This in turn, will allow vulnerable youths to turn away from anti-social
      behaviors. A 30-day programme, the Affirmative Customer Experience seeks to fill the gap created in
      the market for growing demand of professionals in sector of business. The Department of
      Underdeveloped Areas (DUDA), Government of Nagaland, supports the program as a flagship initiative
      under BADP (Border Area Development Program) – Capacity Building Program 2015-16, supports the
      Program.
      <br /><br />
      ACE is a service centric training for retail and hospitality sectors with the dual role of training
      and placement portal. The first batch comprised of 20 trainees selected from Meluri, Mon, and
      Tuensang. The training program envisioned to bring about a far-reaching inclusive approach to
      business activities by infusing young people with ability and skill to provide excellent customer
      service.

      <h3 class='large_margin left_text'>Start-Up Village Entrepreneurship Program (SVEP)</h3>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      With the goal of ‘4 years and 4000 Entrepreneurs’, SVEP aims to tackle the problem of rural poor
      by providing support to small enterprises and skill-based workers, both in terms of training and
      credit support. A flagship program of the Government of India, and a sub-scheme under the National
      Rural Livelihoods Mission (Ministry of Rural Development), it was designed ro bridge the gap of
      business skills, exposure, start up capital, and business support amonst the poor. SVEP envisions
      to work with rural people and marginalized sections, women, SC and ST communities to gain a sense
      of dignity and self-reliance through enterprise development.
      <br /><br />
      In the northeast, Nagaland is the only state chosen for SVEP with Chumukedima and Jakhama block
      for the pilot. Launched in November 2015, it targets to promote 4000 potential entrepreneurs in
      4 years in these two blocks. Entrepreneurs Associates (EA) is the Project Implementing Agency
      (PIA) for SVEP in the two blocks. Since its introduction, people have co-operated in all the
      stages with great enthusiasm.
