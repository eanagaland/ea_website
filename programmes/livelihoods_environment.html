      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      EA promotes innovative farm and livelihood options in the rural areas of Nagaland. With abundant
      and rich natural resources, there is huge untapped opportunity in the region.

      <h3 class='large_margin left_text'>Community Led Mithun Rearing for Livelihood and Conserving Forests</h3>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      One of the most successful livestock projects by Entrepreneurs Associates (EA) is the Community
      led Mithun rearing for Livelihood and Conserving Forests, supported by the Sir Ratan Tata/ Navajbhai
      Ratan Tata Trust, Mumbai. The pilot project began in 2011 in the community forest in Thetsumi village,
      Phek district. Based on the success of the project, the project extended to 4 more villages: Porba,
      Enhulumi, Losami, and Pholami.
      <br /><br />
      The mithun (Bos frontalis) is a valuable animal in the Naga culture. It is reared by villagers in
      the forest wild. EA experimented and studied the traditional strategies of indigenous rearing and
      came up with the barbed wire permamnent fencing of forest areas for mithun rearing. While this
      allowed the mithuns to be reared in protected areas, it crearted mithun sanctuaries where the
      forests were protected. Thus, the project followed a unique method of enhancing passive livelihood
      income through mithun rearing coupled with conservation of forests. Livelihood and conservation
      of forests is a multidimensional issue, which needs concerted and well packaged intervention.

      <h3 class='large_margin left_text'>BBST (Basic Business Skills Training)</h3>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      Basic Business Skills Training (BBST) is a training program designed for entrepreneurs who have
      little, or no education.  EA conducted the BBST training for weavers and artisans with the primary
      focus to instill basic foundation of business and entrepreneurial ventures. The training strives
      to integrate sustainability and survivability through concept, creativity, and innovation in an
      increasingly competitive market. Rigorous sessions on business, entrepreneurship, financial
      management, market networking, customer services, credits and savings are discussed during the
      training.

      <h3 class='large_margin left_text'>Naga Honey</h3>
      <p class='standard_size large_margin justified'>
      In a pioneering pilot project, EA completed a trial run of natural honey under the name ‘Naga Honey’
      to assess the market response. The natural honey is procured from Kiding Village, a tiny village
      tucked in the hills of Tuensang district. Honey bee rearing and harvesting has been an age old
      tradition of the village as depicted by the beautiful folklores of the village. For the project,
      EA worked closely with farmers on a profitable model who engaged in bee rearing by providing
      finance to procure bee boxes, and ensuring quality control to maintain 100% pure honey. In addition
      to the livelihood aspect of the honey project, traditional beekeeping shows great promise to
      improve population of traditional bee species, Apis cerana. Bees are important pollinators
      contributing to conservation of genetically bio-diverse flora in an area.
      <br /><br />
      The EA pilot project under the name Naga Honey; Nagaland’s Natural and Golden Asset participated
      in the Karen’s Farmers’ Market in Pune on February 26, 2017. Thereafter, the team visited the Tata
      Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai campus from March 1-3 where the response from the students
      was overwhelming. And on March 5, 2017, the team participated in the Kavita Mukhi’s Farmers’ Market
      in Mumbai.
